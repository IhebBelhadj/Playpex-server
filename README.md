# Playpex-server

This is an alpha torrent streaming api build on top of peerflix 
Don't have time to write documentations but the code is easy to read 

there is a file called api.js which contains all the api routes you need 
to start the server:
    first install all dependencies by running the command : 
    $ npm install
    then start the server by typing :
    $ npm run start 

This api is straight forward and you can build scalable apps on top of it
